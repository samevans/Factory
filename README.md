# Factory-iphone-game
iPhone game where the user is running the assembly line of a factory for various products. Made in May 2014. This is only a snippet of the code but everything follows Pez.m/Pez.h structure

(August 2015): Looking back at this over a year later I could have used arrays and clever concatenation in for-loops to avoid 19000 line bullshit
